#numbers are either integers or floats
#strings are put within single quotes and can be captured at each index
#lists are in other words arrays, also are within square brackets
#tuples are within parenthesis
#dictionaries have key and value paired components. Work kind of like an object in javascript

#result for 3 + 1.5 + 4
>>> type(3+1.5+4)
<type 'float'>
>>>

#square is ** : 4**2 = 16
#square root 100 ** 0.5
#build [0,0,0] => methond 1 : [0]*3 = [0,0,0] and method 2 : list2 = [0,0,0], then call list2
